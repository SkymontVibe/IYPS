## Overview
Two things that should always be strong: Coffee â˜• and Passwords ðŸ”‘.

In our digital age, where data breaches and hacks have skyrocketed, robust passwords are vital for safeguarding our online accounts. Using a password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) or [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) is strongly recommended for storing and generating unique, strong passwords.
<br>However, if you choose not to use a password manager (seriously though, consider using one), validating the strength of your passwords is crucial. 
 
 This app analyzes password patterns, predicts potential cracking times, and offers helpful suggestions for maximizing security. Additionally, it features a random password & passphrase generator that is configurable. Being entirely offline ensures that your passwords remain exclusively yours.
